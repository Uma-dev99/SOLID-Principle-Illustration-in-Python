# SOLID-Principle-Illustration-in-Python

The SOLID principles are five essential guidelines that enhance software design, making code more maintainable and scalable. They include Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. <br>In this repositry, we’ll explore each principle with examples, highlighting their significance in creating robust and adaptable software systems. These five principles are:

<br>**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
<br>**Open/Closed Principle**
<br>**Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP)**
<br>**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
<br>**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
